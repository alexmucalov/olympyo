You're playing the first game prototype! This farm village has farms, players who own them, and labourers who work them. You're the player indicated in the blue button at the top left of the screen, and your goal is to maximize leisure - indicated beside your player button. <br /><br />You earn one leisure for every turn you don't work. So you own a farm, and you can select it by selecting yourself, and then the farm that you own. You're able to work your farm and set a wage, or not work it and set two wages. When you don't work, you earn one leisure. <br /><br />But be careful: all players and labourers eat one wealth each turn, whether they work or not. And farms are much more productive if two people work them instead of one. Labourers take the highest wages offered in the farm village. Pay too little, and you won't attract labour and make much; but pay too much, and your profits will suffer. <br /><br />And that's basically it! Have fun!
