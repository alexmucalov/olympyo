You're playing the second game prototype! This farm village has farms, human players who own them, and AI labourers who work them. You're the player indicated in the blue button at the top left of the screen, and your goal is to maximize your wealth - indicated beside your player button. <br /><br />You make wealth by setting high wages to attract labour to work your farms. You own one farm to start, and you can select it by selecting yourself, and then the farm that you own. You're able to set two wages on your farms. Farms are much more productive if two labourers work them instead of one. So offer too little, and you won't attract labour and make much; but offer too much, and your profits will suffer. <br /><br />Now, once you accumulate enough wealth, you can select and buy unowned farms at their indicated cost, and potentially make even more wealth. But be careful: all players and labourers eat one wealth each turn, and if your wealth drops to zero, you die.<br /><br />And that's basically it! Have fun!
